# Binary-Mask-to-COCO-Annotation-Format

# Introduction

This is the method to convert binary mask to COCO annotation format. Usually, binary masks are used for U-NET and FPN model training. Suppose, if we want to train the MASK R-CNN model using the same dataset, we need the COCO format annotations.
